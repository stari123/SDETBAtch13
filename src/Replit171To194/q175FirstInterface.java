/*Step1: Create Interface as FirstInterface and create undefined method
    as firstMethod (without parameter).
    Step 2: Create another interface as SecondInterface in which create a
    method as secondMethod (Without Parameter)
    Step 3: Inherit both interfaces to Main class.
    Step 4: Execute both methods
