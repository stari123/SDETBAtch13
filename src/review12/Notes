What is List in java:
    1)It allows us to store duplicates.
    2) insertion order is maintained.
ArrayList and LinkedList are the two most popular implementations of this interface.
ArrayList:
    when 90% of the operations are related to retrieval then we should use ArrayList.
LinkedList:
    when 90% of the operations are manipulation(adding and deleting) operation from any
    where inside the list then we should use LinkedList.
Set:
    Sets does not allow duplicate values.
Most popular classes that have implemented Set interface.
    1) HashSet 2)LinkedHashSet 3) TreeSet.
HashSet:
    Upside: Insertion and retrieval is fastest of all sets.
    Downside: Insertion order is not maintained:
LinkedHashSet:
    UpSide: It maintains the insertion order.
    Downside: slower than Hashset but faster than TreeSet.
    Retrieval speed is slowest of all.
TreeSet:
    Upside: Stores the data in the sorted form.
    DownSide:Insertion speed is slowest of all.
    Retrieval speed better than LinbkedHashSet but slower than the HashSet.
Map interface in java:
    Map allows us to store key value pairs.
Most popular classes that implement the Map interface are.
    1) HashMap 2) LinkedHashMap 3) TreeMap

HashMap:
    UpSide: fastest when it comes to insertion and retrieval.
    DownSide: No insertion order is maintained.
LinkedHashMap:
    Upside: Insertion order is maintained.
    Downside: slower than HashMap but faster than TreeMap.
        Retrieval speed is slowest of all.
Things to revise:
    Classes Objects Constructors methods Inheritance Polymorphism Collections.
