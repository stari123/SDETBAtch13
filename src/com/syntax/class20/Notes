What is Inheritance:
    is a mechanism in java through which one class acquires the properties and methods of
    another class. it is one of the main four pillars of OOPS
Why we should use Inheritance:
    1) it helps reduce the amount of code that we have to write.
    2) it is more efficient.
    3) Saves memory.
How we can use Inheritance:
    we can use the extends keyword after the class name and then the name of the class
    from which we want to inherit the code. Example is given below.
class Parent{
String name="Newton";
String eyeColor="brown";
}
class Child extends Parent{

public void printInfo(){
System.out.println(name+" "+eyeColor);
}
}

Types of Inheritance:
    Different languages support different types of inheritances but 5 are very common.
    1) Single Inheritance.
    2) multilevel Inheritance.
    3) hierarchical Inheritance.
    4) multiple Inheritance.
    5) Hybrid Inheritance.
