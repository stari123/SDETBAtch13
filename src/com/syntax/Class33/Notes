Exception in java:
    Exception is an unwanted behaviour from the application that disrupts the
    normal flow of application.

Exception Handling:
    Exception handling is converting the complex system error messages to
    user-friendly error messages which are understandable by common people.
    we provide backup code that can be used if our primary code fails.
Why we should Handle exceptions:
    1) To make the software user-friendly
    2) It helps use make more robust(better) applications.
    3) We can figure out the exact line numbers and issues that are causing problems in our code(Most important
    for all type of programmers)
What is the syntax how do i use Exception handling in my code:
    We have new keywords like try catch finally throw and throws.
try{
we put that part of the code here that can cause exceptions(problematic code)
}catch(Create a variable of the class whose exception can be thrown){

// Backup code here
}
for example we are tying to read a file this is how we will write our code with exception handling
String path="";
try{
FileInputStream fis=new FileInputStream(path);
Properties pro=new Properties();
pro.load(fis)
}catch(IOException){
sout"pelase check the file at this path"
}
