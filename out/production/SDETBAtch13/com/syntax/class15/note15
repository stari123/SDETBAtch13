How to change theme:
    double click on the shift button twice inside the pop up type theme and hit enter.
    After that you will see the options to change the theme.
What is a method:
    Method in java is block of code(group of java statements). It defines the behaviour
    of a class.

Why we should use methods:
    1) it helps us remove the duplicate code from our application. We just create a method and
    every time we need that logic we just call the method that contains the logic.
    2) It also allows to write the code in the form of modules which makes the development of
    large applications easier.

How to use Methods:
    1) First we create the method inside a class.
    2) We create the object of that class
    3) we call the method by writing the name of the object a dot name of the method

class Calculator{

void add(int x,int y){
System.out.println(x+y);
}

public static void main(String [] args){
Calculator calculator=new Calculator();
calculator.add(10,20);
}

}
Rules to create and use methods:
void add(int x,int y){
System.out.println(x+y);
}
void=> void is a return type and it is a MUST if you want to return a specific data write the name
    of that data type like for int  we write int, for String we write String, and if we don't want to return anything we write void.
    when we write a void we can't assign a method call to a variable.

add=>    next we write the name of the method which can be anything it should follow
         the rules for giving a name to a variable
()=>  We specify the parameters here, we can pass any data type inside these parenthesis.
        They are optional we can leave them empty

 {
 System.out.println(x+y);
 }
 The Body of the method that contains the java statements

  add(int x,int y) => This part with the name of the method and its parameters is called signature of a method

  void add(int x,int y) header of the method
===========================================================
Types of Variables in java:
    There are 3 types of variables 1) local 2) instance 3) static
Local:
    if a variable is inside a method or a part of its parameters or a loop or switch statement or if else condition
    it is called a local variable.

Instance:
    if a variable is inside the class but outside of any block of code like method loop
    switch statement if else condition it is called an instance variable.

static variable:
    if an instance variable has a static keyword with it then it is called a static
    variable

Why learn about different types of variables:
    1) it helps us reduce the amount of RAM that our application will be using when it will be
    running.
    2) With the help of these variables we can pass information between methods of class
    3) Local variables occupy the memory for the shortest period of time as soon as your method is done
    executing they are destroyed by a special program called garbage collector.
    (GARBAGE COLLECTOR)

How to use these:
    Local: create inside block of code

Advantages vs disadvantages

Local variables:
Advantages:
    They occupy the memory for the shortest period of time. Always try to use local
    variables when possible to save memory.
Disadvantages:
    They are very limited in scope means we can't access them outside of method or that block
    of code.

Instance variables:
Advantages:
    They have broader scope as compared to local variables, means we can access in all the methods
    of that class.
Disadvantages:
    They occupy the space in your RAM for longer periods of time.

static Variables:
Advantages:
    We can call static variables without creating an object of a class.
    We can share a single variable between all the objects of a class
