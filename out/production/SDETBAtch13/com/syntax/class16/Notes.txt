There are three types of variables in java local instance static.
Local Variables:
    Are the variables which are created inside a block of code like method,
    loop switch statement if else condition or a constructor.

Advantages:
    We should always prefer local variables to instance or static variables because they
    live for the shortest period of time inside your RAM.
DisAdvantages:
    They can't be accessed outside the block of code in which they are created

Class Countries{

void USA(){
String person="Elisa Bro";
}

void Russia(){
System.out.println(person) // we will get an error because right now Person is only accessible in USA method
}

}

Instance variables:
    They are created inside the class but outside a block of code.

Advantages:
    Instance variables are accessible everywhere in a class in all the blocks of code
    inside that class but not in a static method.

DisAdvantages:
    They keep on occupying the memory for longer periods of time.

static variables:
    if we have a instance variable with a static keyword then it is called as static variable

Advantages:
    They have the highest scope available even outside an object
    and are class level variables that's why it does not matter how many
    objects we create from that class only one variable is  created;
    If we know that a value will stay same for all the objects of a class
    we should always go with static variable that way we can save a lot of memory

DisAdvantages:
    They occupy the memory for longest period of time
    They can hold only a single value for all the objects.
