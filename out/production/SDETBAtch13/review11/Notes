Encapsulation:
    it is one of the pillars of OOP.
    Making the class fields private and creating
    getter setter methods is called encapsulation.
Why we should care about Encapsulation:
    1) it provides privacy
    2) it provides security
How we can use Encapsulation:
    We make the class fields private
    and create methods to access and modify these
    fields.
Rules for Setter Methods:
    1) They should be public
    2) They should have void as return type.
    3) They should have a parameter of same type as field.
Rules for Getter Methods:
    1) They should be public
    2) Their return type should be same as field return type
    3) They should not take any parameters
class BankAccount{
    private String userName;
    private String password;
    private double balance;
    public void setUserName(String userName){
    this.userName=userName;
    }

    public void setPassword(String password){
        this.password=password;
    }

     public void setBalance(double balance){
            this.balance=balance;
     }

     public String getUserName(){
     return userName;
     }

      public String getPassword(){
          return password;
          }

      public double getBalance(){
           return balance;
      }
}

What is Collections Framework:
    Is a set of classes and interfaces.
Why we should use Collections framework?
    The classes inside the Collections framework have many methods to store, retrieve and manipulate the
    data. Using this method it becomes very easy to manipulate the data as compared to Arrays.
    All the classes are not fixed in size. They are battle tested.
How we can use this collections framework:
    All the classes inside the collections framework don't work with the primitive data types.
    we need to use wrapper classes here.
    All the classes in collections framework use generics( a class can work with any datatype but we need
    to specify it first by using diamond operator)

    ArrayList<String> name=new ArrayList<>()
    <String> => <> diamond operator and String is the data type and collectively it is called generics
AutoBoxing and AutoUnboxing:
    when we are working with primitives and colections we don't need to convert these it happens automatically.
    it is a built-in feature of java.
    When a primitive is converted to a wrapper type it is called autoBoxing.
    When a wrapper type is converted to a primitive it is called AutoUnboxing.
Here are few interfaces and classes that we will discuss from collections framework:
    interface: 1)Collection 2)List 3) Set 4) Iterator 5) Map.Entry
    Classes: 1) ArrayList 2) LinkedList 3) HashSet 4) LinkedHasSet 5) TreeHashSet
Utility classes:
Arrays Collections
List:
    1) It can store duplicate values.
    2) insertion order is maintained.
